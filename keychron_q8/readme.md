# Keychron Q8 - Layout(s)

This place contains my layout(s) for Keychron Q8, set using VIA.<br/>
For the details on VIA install and setup, checkout [the product homepage](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q8-alice-layout-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard).

### Procedure

Just to remember:
1. Open VIA.
2. On `Design` tab, drag-n-drop the [Q8_US_ANSI_Knob_V1.5](./Q8_US_ANSI_Knob_V1.5.json) file into it.
3. On `Configure` tab, go to `Save + Load` and click on _Load_ to load the layout (such as [layout 1's JSON file](./layout_1/keychron_q8___layout_1.json)).

Currently, [Layout 1](./layout_1/readme.md) is being used.
