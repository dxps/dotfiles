Layout 2 is based on Layout 1 with some additions:

- Left space (MO(4)) + Left Arrow    = Home
- Left space (MO(4)) + Right Arrow   = End
- Left space (MO(4)) + Up Arrow      = Page Up
- Left space (MO(4)) + Down Arrow    = Page Down
- Left space (MO(4)) + T             = Ctrl + F
- Left space (MO(4)) + Tab           = Alt  + Tab (although it doesn't work for some reason)
- 1st bottom left key (orig Ctrl)    = Alt
