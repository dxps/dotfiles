## Keychron Q8 :: My Layout #3

This is based on the previous one, that is Layout 2, with one addition:

- Left space (MO(4)) + Right Space (Space)    = Win + Space   (used for keyboard layout toggle in Linux)

On layer 3, those MSW... mean Mouse Wheel, and these are placed like this:
```
   [MW left]   [MW up]
   [MW right]  [MW down]
```

## Saved Layout

The layout is saved as [`keychron_q8_layout_3.json`](./keychron_q8_layout_3.json) file.

### Macros

The macro being set are:

- M0 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_A}`
- M1 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_S}`
- M2 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_Z}`
- M3 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_X}`
- M4 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_C}`
- M5 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_V}`
- M6 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_F}`
- M7 is `{+KC_LALT}{KC_TAB}`
  - It almost works as Alt+Tab, except that after selecting the item, you have to press Alt to release it and have that selected item as active and in front.
- M8 is `{KC_LCTL,KC_T}`
- M9 is `{KC_LGUI,KC_SPC}`
